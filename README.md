# Jarvis
A personal assistant I always wanted.

It currently works only in Linux. <br /><br />Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with python3.5.<br /><br />
Need help to extend the functionality to other OS.

To try it:<br />
<code>git clone https://github.com/rohanricky/Jarvis.git</code><br />
<code>cd Jarvis</code>

To install dependencies:<br />
<code>python setup.py</code>

To open the GUI:
<code>python gui.py</code>

To open only voice interface:
<code>python jarvis.py</code>

To open any website:
Use <b> open youtube / launch youtube </b> to open youtube
Use <b> download [song name with artist]</b> to download mp3 song.

If there are any issues with the module/want more features: Submit an issue [here](https://github.com/rohanricky/Jarvis/issues)
